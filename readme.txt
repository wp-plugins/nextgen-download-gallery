Add a template to NextGEN Gallery that provides multiple-file downloads for trade/media galleries

== Description ==

Add a template to NextGEN Gallery that provides multiple-file downloads for trade/media galleries. [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) is one of the best gallery plugins for WordPress because it is very flexible and has a nice, simple admin. This plugin adds a new gallery template that lets you select multiple images from the gallery to be downloaded as a ZIP archive.

This plugin is targetted at creating "Trade/Media" areas on websites, allowing journalists to easily download multiple product images. It's apparently very popular with photographers too.

= Credits =

This program incorporates some code that is copyright by Photocrati Media 2012 under the GPLv2. Some PHP code was copied from NextGEN Gallery and altered, so that the `nggtags` shortcode could be extended as `nggtags_ext` and specify a gallery template.

== Installation ==

1. Install [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) and create galleries/albums
2. Upload this plugin to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Specify the gallery template as "download"

= From a gallery shortcode =

When using a shortcode to show a NextGEN gallery, you can make it a download gallery by specifying the gallery template:

`[nggallery id=1 template=download]`

= From an album shortcode =

When using a shortcode to show a NextGEN album, you can make it show download galleries by specifying the gallery template:

`[nggalbum id=1 gallery=download]`

= From a tags shortcode =

The standard `nggtags` shortcode doesn't allow you to specify the gallery template, so this plugin adds an extended version of that shortcode.

`[nggtags_ext gallery="frogs,lizards" template=download]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work without NextGEN Gallery? =

No. [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) is doing all the work. This plugin is only adding a new gallery template and the ZIP download functionality.

= Can I make an album use the download template? =

Yes, the album shortcode has separate parameters for album and gallery templates. The "template" parameter tells it which template to use for the album, and the "gallery" parameter tells it which template to use for the gallery. e.g.

`[nggalbum id=1 template=compact gallery=download]`

= Can I make the tags shortcode use the download template? =

Not directly; the `nggtags` shortcode doesn't support a template parameter, but this plugin adds a new shortcode that does.

`[nggtags_ext gallery="frogs,lizards" template=download]`

= I don't like the download template; can I customise it? =

Yes. Copy the template from the templates folder in the plugin, into a folder called nggallery in your theme's folder. You can then edit your copy of the template to get the pretty.

= Why does it break when I select too many images? =

There can be several reasons, but the most common one is that your server is limiting the size of temporary files. You might be able to work around that by telling WordPress to use your uploads folder for temporary files. To do that, add this line to your wp-config.php file, just below the lines defining ABSPATH near the bottom of the file:

`define('WP_TEMP_DIR', ABSPATH . '/wp-content/uploads/');`

= You've translated my language badly / it's missing =

The initial translations were made using Google Translate, so it's likely that some will be truly awful! Please help by editing the .po file for your language and tell me about it in the support forum.

= Can I change the image paths, to download a different image? =

If you have higher resolution images you'd like to download instead of the ones displayed, you can use a filter hook. See [this support post](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/linking-to-hr-images-again#post-4385317) for details.
